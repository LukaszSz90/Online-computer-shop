Final project in the Software Development Academy -> simple computer store website

Login as a user - login: klient1@user.pl   password: klient1
Login as administrator - login: admin@admin.pl    password: admin

I propose to register as a new user with imaginary data, (e.g. login: ab@ab.com pass: 1111) the reason is that some functions work properly when we register as a new user.
